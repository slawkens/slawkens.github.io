## About Me

You may know me as _slawkens_.

That's the nickname I took long time ago, in the time when internet was not so popular yet, well maybe already, but in the times when I was starting my adventure with programming.

In my open source journey I was one of the main developers of the open source project called The Forgotten Server, from version 0.3 up to 0.4, in early development.

My real name however, is: Slawomir Boczek.

I program in my spare time some open source projects, that gives me massive amount of joy.

In my professional carrier as a software developer, I worked in the company netz98 - the biggest Magento agency in Germany.

Currently I work as IT Specialist in small company in the Frankfurt Area.
